        <h2>The Struggles Are Real</h2>
        <p>
            Learning to code has been a <span class="highlight">rollercoaster of emotions</span>. At first, I was excited about the prospect of creating amazing applications and solving real-world problems. But little did I know, this journey would test my patience, resilience, and determination.
        </p>

        <h2>Moments of Frustration</h2>
        <p>
            There were days when I stared at my screen for hours, trying to fix a bug that just wouldn't go away. The errors seemed cryptic, and I often wondered if I was even cut out for this field. Debugging felt like solving a puzzle where some pieces were missing.
        </p>

        <h2>The Endless Learning Curve</h2>
        <p>
            Just when I thought I had mastered one concept, a new one would pop up that made me feel like a beginner again. Spring MVC, Hibernate, Reactâ€”each of them came with their own set of challenges. The process of constantly adapting felt overwhelming at times.
        </p>

        <h2>Small Wins</h2>
        <p>
            Despite the struggles, there were moments of triumph. When I finally made my first Spring MVC project work, I felt like a coding superhero! These small victories kept me going, reminding me why I started this journey in the first place.
        </p>

        <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
        <p>
            Through the tears, late nights, and countless cups of coffee, I've learned that coding is not just about writing code. It's about <span class="highlight">problem-solving, persistence, and creativity</span>. It's about asking for help when needed and celebrating progress, no matter how small.
        </p>

        <h2>The Road Ahead</h2>
        <p>
            While the journey has been tough, I know it's shaping me into a better developer and a stronger person. I still have a long way to go, but I'm ready to face whatever challenges come my way. After all, nothing worth having comes easy.
